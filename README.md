**Project Title: Mad Lib Game**

Mad Lib is an interactive word game where players fill in blanks with specific types of words (like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to create a humorous or surprising story. The structure of the story is pre-written, with key parts left blank for players to fill in without knowing the full context. Once completed, the story is revealed, often resulting in funny or unexpected outcomes.
